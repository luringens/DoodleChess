### Subtask 3 + 4 - choose a process for the team

**Agile**: meet biweekly, talk about what we got done, discuss how tasks went,
define new tasks, assign new tasks
* Tuesday/Thursday meetings

  group leader
* Write documentation and tests as we go
* Stian writes more about the process

### User stories

1. Failure in system
1. How a piece of the chessboard should behave
1. Consider the entire user interface

#### Part 1: what sorts of issues can we run into when working in a team?

Discuss risks, etc.

#### Part 2: how do we want the users to interact with the application

  * Hover mouse over piece to see possible moves
  * Drag-and-drop pieces

### Core competence crash course

#### Markdown

Markdown is a markup language which can be edited by any plain text editor and
makes stuff look good. It's good for writing quick notes.

Stian went through
* Headlines
* Text
* Unordered lists
* Ordered lists
* Tables
* Code blocks

Markdown rendering is supported by GitLab and GitHub, as well as a variety of
plugins or programs you can install on your computer. The README.md file in any
folder in GitLab repos is displayed below the files in the folder.

## Meeting review

### What worked?

### What didn't work?

Didn't have "summary" at the start, structure of meeting was a bit loose

Hard to keep the group focused, meeting stagnated when individuals got busy

## Conclusion

Next meeting agenda: 
* Presentation
* Retrospective

The next meeting will be Thursday, 2018-02-15, 14:15-16:00, in group room 205M3,
HÃ¸yteknologisenteret or the room of the last meeting, whichever is free.

# Retrospective note
* Mutiny, unideal role assignment initially
