\section*{The good parts}

We understood the task and knew what we had to do. We had someone who was experienced with git and someone who was experienced with LaTeX, so they were able to resolve technical issues with those tools. Whenever anyone needed help they reached out and got help quickly. We had good attendance and rarely missed anyone.

\section*{The challenges}

We found it difficult to seperate the tasks into enough subtasks for eight people. This resulted in tasks that had to wait on others before they could finish themselves, causing coordination issues. This was partially mitigated by meeting often and communicating online, but it was still challenging and took a lot of time in the meetings. \\

\noindent We had some issues deciding on a communication channel to use, but in the end Discord was picked as our primary tool for communication. \\

\noindent There was also a problem getting everyone to focus on a single topic at once during the meetings --- often, smaller groups would form and focus on a specific problem, even when everyones attention was required. This can be mitigated in the future by team lead taking a more authorative role and demanding attention.
