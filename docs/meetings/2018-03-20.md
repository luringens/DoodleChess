## Meeting review

### What worked?

Solved a lot of specific issues people were having, made advances in coordination and got a better overview of what's required to do and who's to do it. People worked diligently on their own separate tasks.

### What didn't work?

It was extremely difficult to get a proper overview of what's going on, what's remaining, and who can do what. It's difficult to assign tasks to people because not everyone has a clear understanding of every part of the project. Coordination was difficult. Confusion abounded.

## Summary

This meeting was mostly dedicated to coordination, task assignment, and planning for the future.

**Next meeting:** Thursday 2018-03-22, 14:15-16:00, HÃ¸yteknologisenteret
