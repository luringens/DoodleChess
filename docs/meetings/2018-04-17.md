### Task pushed to backlog
- #86 Black/white labels changed
  - This is not critical to this iteration. We may complete it if we find the time, but we have too much to worry about as it is.

Aside from the tasks previously discussed, all other tasks are now completed.

## Meeting review

### What worked?

Got quickly started, distributed all the tasks that were to be distributed.

### What didn't work?

It was difficult to distribute tasks, as our core competence in UI will be spread thin due to a lot of things that need to be integrated with the UI.

## Summary

We managed to complete task distribution and advance some of the tasks to be done.

**Next meeting:** Thursday, 2018-04-19, HÃ¸yteknologisenteret
