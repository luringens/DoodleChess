Feedback INF112 Spring 2018 - Oblig 2

Group: Group 6

#### Overall feedback

Good delivery:
  - Overall good answers on most of the tasks
  - Very good structure of documents (especially the meeting reports)

Some parts of assignment is missing (functional and nonfunctional requirements).
Also some errors with the diagrams in the product specification.

#### Content

+ Product specification

  + Good description of objective. Very good use cases.

  + The class-diagram is good, but could use some aggregation arrows, e.g. between board and chesspiece.

  + The use case diagram is not a proper use case diagram, this is a flowchart. This should be redone later.

  + User stories are also missing "because"- at the end. E.g. As a ... I want ... so that ... This should also be redone later.

    > As a user I want to see which pieces are taken, so that I can have an overview of the game.

  + Functional and nonfunctional requirements mostly missing, only added system requirements. Review Chapter 4. Sec 4.1.

+ Team plan

  Good overall, missing specific roles for team-member, only listed skills.
  Good git structure description, but missing some git repo structure planning (folders etc.)

  Since Trello is going to keep track of the list of task, and the most relevant part
  who will be working on a specific task, you may provide someway to see your trello project.
  We also recommend to use issues for these purposes like assigning task and keep track of the merge code.

+ User manual

  Clear user group and goal. Missing some key features, and also missing some rules for when the
  game ends, e.g. winning, resigning and so on. Also some errors with the figures 7,8,9, and 10.

+ Project plan and process

  Very good overall, description of chosen process could be better (describe what scrum is a bit more, and describe the
  changes you are going to make to this process). Some misspellings.

+ Retrospective summary

  Very good, only missing some tools, like what you are going to use to develop the game (e.g. libGDX, javafx etc.)

+ Presentation

  Very nice slides and good presentation overall.

+ Team organization

  The team organization has a good distribution but as you notice it's not final
  and in the first stages it would be better to have more coders than testers or
  people in graphics in order to complete the minimum functional requirements
  faster. So I suggest to keep one person in each job at the beginning.
