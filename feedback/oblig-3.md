Overall feedback

You're doing a great job. The repository looks now like a serious project. ;)

  - Good README and other git files.
  - Good manage of the issue-tracker. Good commits and messages.
  - A lot activity in the repository. Many members participating.
  - Good job with the minutes. Keeping revelant discussions and showing
    us real problematics as it happens working on a team but also
    the way you are handling to solve all your issues.

- License was missing before the deadline but it was added later.

- Despite the fact the game is nice, the interface could be have
  a better text font, maybe stronger like other stuff in the game.

- Aspects to improve in the deliverables:

  + The UML diagram is missing the attributes in each class but
    also the relevant methods. Both with their respective type.

    The design model should be fixed e.g. following the examples sent by Torill.

Score: 90.8 (of 100)
