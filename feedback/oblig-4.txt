Feedback INF112 spring 2018 - Oblig.4

Group: Syntax Highlighters




Overall feedback:
Very good delivery. Most of the previous errors have been fixed, and both the game and
the documentation is mostly on point.


Deliverable: Minutes/ meeting reports
Seems that you cover the things you should, good.


Deliverable: Chess game + code quality
Good, really nice graphics and the game seems to be working for the most part. 
The expert AI might be a bit slow and laggy (especially for slower computers) 
and also not that hard to beat. Also the scoreboard does not seem to update the score 
and statistics properly when completing a game.  


Deliverable: Retrospective summary
Overall good, no comments for this.


Deliverable: License + trello/issue tracker/backlog
Still relevant and up to date. 


Deliverable: Presentation
Nice slides and good presentation overall.


Deliverable: Sequence diagram
Very good, the multiplayer game is a bit messy though 


Deliverable: Design/class diagram
This is also much better this time, most of the diagram is correct. Only comment to be made is
that there are some instances where using "composition" arrows (filled diamond arrow) 
might be more correct than using "aggregation" arrows (hollow diamond arrow). 
E.g. between classes like game and move (can the move class exist without the game class?).


Score: 99.3 (of 100)

Evaluation: PASS
